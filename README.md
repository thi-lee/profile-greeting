### Hi, I'm Thi Le <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

🍵  My name is pronounced like "tea"
👩‍💻  I’m currently working on my personal website
🌱  I’m currently learning React, data structure and algorithms, all via the magical Internet and Google
💬  I'dd love to talk about life as an international student, community college transfer, and funny memes I laughed at today
🥅  My goal in 2021 is to not get Covid-19 and have a merry 2021 Christmas
⚡   I take part in diversifying the tech industry (all the while realizing I also need to diversify my life)
