### Hi, I'm Thi Le <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> <br> <hr>

 🍵  &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is pronounced like "tea" <br><br>
 👩‍💻  &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m currently working on my personal website <br><br>
 🌱  &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m currently learning React, data structure and algorithms, all via the magical Internet and Google <br><br>
 💬  &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides tech stuff, I'd love to talk about life as an international student, community college transfer, and a good book <br><br>
 🥅  &nbsp; &nbsp; My goal in 2021 is to not get Covid-19 and have a merry 2021 Christmas <br><br>
 ⚡   &nbsp; &nbsp; I take part in diversifying the tech industry (all the while realizing I also need to diversify my life) <br><br>
